# Mitcoin
Made by **Mitrue** and **PotatOS**
 - A Discord bot that simulates a cryptocurrency
 - Users can invest, sell, and give MTC as the value changes in order to increase their overall balance
 - Mitcoin value, all user balances, all users in the blacklist, and a history of past values are stored in a database automatically
 - Blacklisted users are not allowed to participate in the Mitcoin economy, but can still use commands to view information
